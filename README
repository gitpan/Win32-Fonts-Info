Win32::Fonts::Info is a module to get informations about installed font families.
The module was tested with Windows XP and Windows 2000.

For more informations on how to use it please see POD documentation.

My intention to create this module was that someone in a Perl win32 user group 
asked how to find out which fonts are installed on a Windows system. A resaerch
in the Platform SDK showed me that there are some different methods to do it
(GDI, GDI+, Registry, WMI). Each of them are showing me different number of
of fonts. So I preferred to use the GDI API. The number of font files which can be found in
the %Windir%\fonts directory is different to the number of font families calculated by
the module.
